- 👋 Hi, my name is Stan.

- 👀 I’m interested in finance, derivative pricing, crypto, algotrading and web3.
- 🏦 I’m currently working as a model validation quant at Deutsche Bank.
- ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3670A0?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=ffdd54) I worked as a Python Developer for Move Digital AG on a market events detection software.
- 🌱 My current free time project is about fitting RNNs to generated data. The goal is to reproduce fundamental features of the underlying process which generates the data.
- Previously I have also worked on monitoring prices on UniSwap with the goal of implementing a trading bot.
